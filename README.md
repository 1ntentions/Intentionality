# Intentionality

## To use  
This local website utilizes a local database to store values such as budget category balances and budget allocation percentages.  
My "intentionality.sql" file includes a link on how to install and use phpMyAdmin to locally host a database.  
This file also shows the localhost port that I used (8889), as well as the format of the table that I used to store user data.  
I additionally use MAMP to start my SQL server.

## Future updates
Remotely hosting a database for user data so that users do not have to go through so many steps to host their own database to properly use my website.
