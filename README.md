# Intentionality  
Intentionality is a local budgeting website that allows its users to choose what percentage of their income to allocate to needs, savings, investments, and savings categories. The website utilizes a local database to store values such as budget category balances and budget allocation percentages.  
This website is meant to help adults maneuver with improved intentions toward their finances.

## To use  
-My "intentionality.sql" file includes a link on how to install and use phpMyAdmin to locally host a database.  
-You can copy and paste the SQL code for the creation of my table to store user data from the "intentionality.sql" file as well.  
-I additionally use MAMP to start my SQL server.

## Future updates
-Remotely hosting a database for user data so that users do not have to go through so many steps to properly use my website.
