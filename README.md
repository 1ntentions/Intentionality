# Intentionality  
Intentionality is a budgeting website that allows its users to choose what percentage of their income to allocate to needs, savings, investments, and savings categories. The website utilizes a remote database to store values such as budget category balances and budget allocation percentages.  
This website is meant to help adults maneuver with improved intentions toward their finances.  

I have included all of the php and css files that I used to create this website, except with "db.php" as a version that instead works for a local database set up on a server "localhost:8889", as I do not wish to share the username and password to the remote database that I created.
